abstract class 

	having abstract and nob abstract method 
	we can not create instance of abstract class 
	we have to create child and override all the abstact method from abstract class 	
interface 
	its pure abstract class 
	all methods are public and abstract 
	all variables are public static and final 
	
final variables are constant and can not modify 

we don't have abstract variable we have abstract method and if method is 
abstract then class must be an abstract


we can have constructor in abstract class 

we can not have constructor in interface 

we can not create instance of interface 

-------------------------------------------------------------

you can give any name to java file , when you compile your java file you have to 
compile with filename 

javac filename.java 
java className


it is not necessary that you save your java file with main method class name. 

if you have public class , then you must have to save java file with that public class name

by default in cpp all methods are private but in java all methods are default 

so we have 4 access specifier 

private
default
protected 
public
